Steps: 1. Inspect the website using Devtools

2. Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract elements from the website
   
3. Extract the title and preview of the news articles and store in a Python Data Structure

Example:

{'title': "NASA's MAVEN Observes Martian Light Show Caused by Major Solar Storm",
  'preview': 'For the first time in its eight years orbiting Mars, NASAâ€™s MAVEN mission witnessed two different types of ultraviolet aurorae simultaneously, the result of solar storms that began on Aug. 27.'}

Analyzing dataset using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:

1. How many months exist on Mars?
Answer: 12 months

2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
Answer: 1867

3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?

Answer: Coldest month in Curiosity location is 3rd month

Hottest month in Curiosity location is 8th month

4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?

Answer: Lowest Stmospheric Pressure on Mars is observed in the 6th month

Highest Pressure on Mars is observed in the 9th month

5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
   
Visually estimating the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.

Answer: The distance from peak to peak is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot. Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.
